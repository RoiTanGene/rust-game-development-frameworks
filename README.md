# What framework to use for X?

## ![Community Icon](./community-icon.png) [Invitation link to the ***Game Development in Rust*** Discord server](https://discord.gg/yNtPTb2)

This curated list is from the **Game Development in Rust** Discord server and prioritizes frameworks that have examples and are ready or almost ready for production. This list was made so it can be shared with beginners.

For a longer list of frameworks, see [Are We Game Yet?](https://arewegameyet.rs).

- [glfw](https://docs.rs/glfw) Rust wrapper for the C GLFW3 library.
- [fermium](https://docs.rs/fermium) Rust wrapper for the C SDL2 library. Contains more than window creation features.
- [sdl2](https://docs.rs/sdl2) Rust wrapper for the C SDL2 library. Contains more than window creation features.

## Frameworks for ECS

- [hecs](https://docs.rs/hecs) Minimalist, ergonomic API without performance compromises.
- [legion](https://docs.rs/legion)
- [shipyard](https://docs.rs/shipyard)

## Frameworks for linear math (for 2D and 3D programming) and physics

- [cgmath](https://docs.rs/cgmath)
- [glam](https://docs.rs/glam)
- [nalgebra](https://docs.rs/nalgebra)
- [nphysics2d](https://docs.rs/nphysics2d) / [nphysics3d](https://docs.rs/nphysics3d)

- [vek](https://docs.rs/vek)

## Font (parser and/or rasterizer)

- [fontdue](https://docs.rs/fontdue) Pure Rust. No `std` dependency.

## Space Partitioning 


- [rstar](https://docs.rs/crate/rstar/) n-dimensional [r*-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R*_tree) implementation
- [bvh](https://docs.rs/crate/bvh/) Bounding Volume Hierarchy, built on top of [nalgebra](https://www.nalgebra.org/).
- [kdtree](https://docs.rs/crate/kdtree/) K-dimensional tree in Rust for fast geospatial indexing and nearest neighbors lookup.
- **ncollide** has its own Bounding Volume Tree implementation: [3d docs](https://www.ncollide.org/rustdoc/ncollide3d/partitioning/struct.BVT.html) and [2d docs](https://www.ncollide.org/rustdoc/ncollide2d/partitioning/struct.BVT.html).
- [spade](https://docs.rs/crate/spade/) Implements  [r*-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R*_tree) and [delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation).
- [flat_spatial](https://docs.rs/crate/flat_spatial/) Simple flat structures such as a grid/hashmap of cells.
- [acacia](https://docs.rs/crate/acacia/)  Generic over the dimension of the partitioned space and thus supports binary trees, quadtrees, octrees, etc.

## Audio

- [alto](https://docs.rs/alto) Wrapper for OpenAL. Hardly any further development expected, as OpenAL is a well established library.
- [openal](https://docs.rs/openal) Wrapper for OpenAL. Hardly any further development expected, as OpenAL is a well established library.
- [rodio](https://docs.rs/rodio)
